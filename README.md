# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project
This is a Power BI end-to-end project

In this project, I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
Used complex parameters to drill down in the worksheet and all customisations were implemented using filters and slicers.
Created connections, joined new tables, calculations were done for data manipulation and also user driven parameters have been enabled for visualizations.
Used different types of customized visualizations (stacked bar chart, stacked column chart, donut chart, map slicers, cards, etc.)
